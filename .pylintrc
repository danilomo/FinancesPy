# Allow optimization of some AST trees. This will activate a peephole AST
# optimizer, which will apply various small optimizations. For instance, it can
# be used to obtain the result of joining multiple strings with the addition
# operator. Joining a lot of strings can lead to a maximum recursion error in
# Pylint and this flag can prevent that. It has one side effect, the resulting
# AST will be different than the one from reality. This option is deprecated
# and it will be removed in Pylint 2.0.
